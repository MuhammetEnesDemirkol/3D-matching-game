***Project Objectives and Requirements**

***Project Objectives**
*Main Objective: To develop an interactive mini-game with 3D objects using Unity.*
*Have players drop two identical objects on a lid to make them disappear.*
*Show a message that the game is over when all objects are destroyed.*
*Provide visual feedback to the player by throwing objects to a random location in the area when they are different.*

**Technical Requirements**

**1.Stage Setup**
*Camera: A camera set to show the playing field in a fixed position.*
*Play Area: A central area where objects are placed and a cover area at the bottom.*

**2.3D Objects**
**Different types of 3D objects, two of each in the game.*
*Adding Rigidbody and Collider components to give physical behavior to objects.*

**Cover Mechanism**
*When two objects of the same type are dropped on the lid, the objects should disappear.*
*A checking mechanism that compares tags or properties of objects for cover checking.*

**Limitations**
*Invisible boundaries or position-limiting codes to prevent objects from moving out of the camera.*

**Game End**
*When all objects are destroyed, the screen should display “Game Over”.*

**Feedback and Interaction**
*When different objects are dropped on the cover, they should be thrown somewhere.*
*Use of physics engine to make the movement of objects realistic.*

**Target User Experience**

*The player can drag and drop objects with a simple control mechanism.*
*The game is quickly understandable and playable.*
*Clear feedback on the screen to communicate the situation to the player.*
